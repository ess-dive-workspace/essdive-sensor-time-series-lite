### unit
The controlled vocabulary for the unit is based on the [Unified Code of Unified Measurements (UCUM)](https://ucum.org/ucum). The Definition provided for the controlled vocabulary is the UCUM code.

### measured_variable
Use the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI) [Variable Name controlled vocabulary](https://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV&id=1157579162) "Term" column for the `measured_variable` field. CHUASHI's controlled vocabulary is based upon [ODM2's variable name controlled vocabulary](http://vocabulary.odm2.org/variablename/).

### statistic
|Controlled Vocabulary|Definition|
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| mean | ISO 3534: 2006-1 sample mean (average, arithmetic mean) sum of random variables in a random sample divided by the number of terms in the sum |
| minimum | Minimum value |
| median | ISO 3534: 2006-1 sample median [(*n*+1)/2]th order statistic, if the sample size (see ISO 3534-2:2006, 1.2.26) *n* is odd; sum of the (*n*/2)th and [(*n*/2) + 1]th order statistics divided by 2, if the sample size *n* is even |
| maximum | Maximum value |
| total | Sum or cumulative amount measured during the sampling period |
| standard deviation | ISO 3534:2006-1 standard deviation: positive square root of the variance; or sample standard deviation: non-negative square root of the sample variance |
| standard error | ISO 3534:2006-1 standard error: standard deviation of an estimator. An estimator of the standard error is the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of samples. |
| measurement uncertainty | [JCGM 200:2012, 3rd edition](https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/2.26.html) measurement uncertainty: non-negative parameter characterizing the dispersion of the quantity values being attributed to a measured (`measured_variable`), based on the information used |
| R2 | Coefficient of determination |
| RMSE | Root mean square error |
| p-value | ISO 3534:2006-1 p-value: probability of observing the observed test statistic value or any other value at least as unfavourable to the null hypothesis |
| CV | ISO 3534:2006-1 sample coefficient of variation: sample standard deviation divided by the sample mean |
| covariance | ISO 3534:2006-1 sample covariance: sum of products of deviations of pairs of random variables in a random sample from their sample means divided by the number of terms in the sum minus one |
